# Bryan Johnson's GWU Module 14 - Interactive Visaulizations Assignment READ ME File

## The files for this assignment can be found at the following repo:
https://github.com/bryanpijohnson/belly-button-challenge

### Or, it can be found at my newly created GitHub Pages page:
https://bryanpijohnson.github.io/belly-button-challenge/

## Within the repo link, you will find the following folders and files to be reviewed and graded:

- **README.md** - that is this file :)
- **index.html** - this is the HTML file that generates the page at https://bryanpijohnson.github.io/belly-button-challenge/
- **static** - this folder houses the data and other code files that generated the visualizations in the HTML file.
    - **js** - this folder holds the **app.js** file that holds the javascript code.
    - **samples.json** - this is the initial data that we were supposed to look at the help with the code, even though we use the URL API call.

## Initial Set Up and Issues

My biggest problem was recognizing that I had to do the data handling within the d3.json call to the API. Otherwise, I wouldn't be able to work with the data in an easy way. Once I realized / was told this, it was much easier to get to work.

Another issue I ran into was trying to get the gauge to work. I searched as much as I could to get it to match the actual gauge in the homework assignment example, but wasn't able to add the labels or make the half-circle thicker, without starting over and basically copying code from somewhere else, which I don't want to do.
